A podcast that you can edit has been updated because one of its feeds was changed:

<% @podcast.last_changes.reject { |k,v| k.to_s != 'original_title' }.each_pair do |attr, changes| -%>
  <%= attr.titleize %> was changed to '<%= changes.last %>'
<% end -%>

It is located at <%= podcast_url(:podcast_slug => @podcast, :host => @host) %>

Thanks,
LimeCast
